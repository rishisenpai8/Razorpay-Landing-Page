🛠 Tech Stack
HTML5 — semantic markup
TailwindCSS — styling and responsive layout
JavaScript (Vanilla) — carousel interaction & animations

⚙️ Installation & Setup
Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/razorpay-landing-clone.git
cd razorpay-landing-clone
Install dependencies (if using Tailwind via npm)


npm install
Run Tailwind CLI to build styles
npx tailwindcss -i ./css/tailwind.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch
Open index.html in your browser to preview.

📌 Notes
The carousel and banner animations are purely front-end and static — no backend functionality.
While the carousel works for demonstration, it’s built to showcase UI design, not production-ready logic.
Great project to demonstrate UI/UX thinking in portfolios and resumes.
